# Dice-Game-2.0

##### This Project is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## ABOUT :
* It is a fun 2-player game where the players have to reach the target score. First one to achieve the target score will be declared WINNER.
             
## HOW TO PLAY :
* The red dot points the active player.
* The active player rolls the dice.
* Each player has 'CURRENT' score (temporary score) and the 'TOTAL' score.  
* The player can continue to roll the dice and the sum of both the dices will get added to the 'CURRENT' score of the active player.
* If the player wish to hold the 'CURRENT' score, the 'CURRENT' score will be added to the player's 'TOTAL' score and the next player will    get the turn.
        
## RULES :
1. The default target score is 50.
2. The target score can be changed during the game but the target score can't be less than or equal to 0 otherwise the target score will      automatically set to 50.
3. If both the dices show same number then the active player will loose the 'CURRENT' score and the next player will get the turn.
4. If a player rolls a (6 6) then the 'TOTAL' score of the current player will be reset to 0.
